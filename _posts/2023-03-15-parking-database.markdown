**What is parking reform?**

Parking is mundane, inevitable, and rage-inducing. However, to many communities, it is a vehicle for change in affordable housing, climate change, and safer streets. 

One of the most common ways cities and states have changed their parking codes is by removing them all together. Across the United States and the world, there are parking minimums required for new and/or re-use developments. While some safety codes and building codes are often written in blood, parking code cannot claim the same. Resources that were used to develop parking codes have poor data and is based on peak hours, which leaves many parking lots empty most of the time. Additionally, there is the argument of letting supply, demand, and the free market to dictate how many parking spaces a developer allocates. 

The Parking Reform Network is a dedicated, advocacy organization for parking reform. Amongst its tools, resources, and advocacy, is a parking reform map, which tracks parking reform across the country (and eventually around the world, too).
